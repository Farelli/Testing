echo Debian seems to not have sudo installed by default.  
echo Here is how to install sudo and add your username to the sudoers file.
echo 
echo Open the Terminal
echo Switch to root user
         su
echo     - now type in the root password and press [enter]
echo         - The command prompt should now look like this...
echo             root@debian:/home/swgemu#
echo     
echo Install "sudo"
         apt-get install sudo
echo     - then press [enter]
echo 
echo Add your username to the sudo group
echo     - Type in the following command...
echo         adduser swgemu sudo

echo Now add your name to /etc/sudoers file
         nano /etc/sudoers
echo     - then press [enter]
echo     - Scroll down and look for the line "%sudo  ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL"
echo     - Below that line type in the following...
echo         swgemu  ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
echo     - Press "Ctrl+x" then press "y" and then press [enter] to exit and save the file
echo Now we exit out of the Terminal completely
         exit
         exit
echo     - That should have closed the Terminal application 
echo Now let's open a new Terminal and test to see if sudo is working for your user name

         sudo ls

echo     - type in your password and press [enter]
echo     - If the output looks like the following...
echo         swgemu is not in the sudoers file.  This incident will be reported.
echo     - then you might have to start from the beginning of these instructions and try again.
echo 
echo     - If the output looks like this...
echo         Desktop  Documents  Downloads  Music  Pictures  Public  Templates  Videos
echo     - Your username now has sudo rights, congratulations!
echo 
echo Enjoy!
